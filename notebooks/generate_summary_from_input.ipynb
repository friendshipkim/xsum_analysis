      " ['In very blustery conditions the Sons secured victory courtesy of a goal from Mark Docherty, who had scored in August\\'s 1-0 win over the Tangerines.\\nHis cross evaded everyone and the wind played a part as the ball whipped into the net past goalkeeper Cammy Bell.\\nWith Hibernian winning earlier in the day at Falkirk, United slip to second going into 2017.\\nDumbarton began on the front foot. Docherty fired in a shot from 25 yards, but it was comfortably held by Bell.\\nSam Stanton also tried his luck for the hosts, firing just wide of the post.\\nEventually Dumbarton would get their reward for a positive start. Docherty slung in a cross from the left and soon celebrated a deserved lead for the Sons.\\nIt took half-an-hour for United to muster any meaningful sight of goal. Stewart Murdoch shot from 25 yards but it was easily held by Alan Martin.\\nUnited did have the ball in the back of the net just before half-time when Simon Murray fired home from close range, but it was ruled out for offside.\\nAnd just after the interval United struck the bar through an unorthodox back-heeled effort from Mark Durnan following a corner.\\nSubstitute Cammy Smith had a shot deflected up on to the roof of the Dumbarton net. Scott Fraser also fired a free-kick just over the bar for the visitors.\\nIn stoppage time United came so close to an equaliser, Coll Donaldson hitting the post with a header from a corner.\\nDumbarton manager Steve Aitken: \"I would have taken that scoreline before the game. It was always going to be tough with the conditions but most importantly we were playing against the league leaders who for 14 or 15 weeks have been terrific and deserve to be top of the league and I\\'m sure they will challenge all the way to the end. The fact we have won at home against them is very pleasing.\\n\"It\\'s been a great 2016 for me personally, we\\'ve come in here and we managed to stay up last year against all the odds. We were tipped to go down this year, and although we\\'re only half way through the season we have shown that we are competitive. But we will enjoy it. We have to work hard in January, players will come and go, other teams will strengthen and will try and do the same.\\n\"It is a big few weeks ahead of us but we\\'ll enjoy it and get back to work on Tuesday.\"\\nDundee United manager Ray McKinnon: \"I think the weather summed up the day today perfectly. It was just about impossible to play football in those conditions - I\\'m not making excuses at all - but it\\'s certainly not ideal weather to be playing football in, especially when you\\'re asking a team to be very technical and play a certain way.\"\\n\"We\\'re disappointed with the result but I\\'m going to be mindful of the fact the team has been 13 games unbeaten and we have lost in really bad conditions today. We have to take that on the chin, we have to regroup, a big game on Friday [against Hibs] and I\\'m sure the boys will be motivated for the game on Friday.\"\\n\"[On the Tony Andreu injury, which saw the player miss out today] He\\'s got a strain in between his rib and it\\'s precautionary. He was struggling today and we just thought we wouldn\\'t take any chances with him. Hopefully he\\'s nice and fresh and over his injury for next week.\"\\nMatch ends, Dumbarton 1, Dundee United 0.\\nSecond Half ends, Dumbarton 1, Dundee United 0.\\nAttempt missed.
